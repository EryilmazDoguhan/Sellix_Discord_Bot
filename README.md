<h1>Discord Sellix Verification Bot</h1>
This is a Python-based Discord bot that helps automate the verification process for customers who made a successful purchase on Sellix. The bot assigns a designated "Member" role to the verified customers and notifies the server admins about each sale in a specific channel.

<h2>Features</h2>
On-demand verification: Users can use the !verify command to request verification.
Sellix API Integration: The bot utilizes the Sellix API to check the status of a user's purchase and verify their membership.
Role Assignment: If a user has a successful sale on Sellix, they will be assigned the "Member" role in the Discord server.
Admin Notifications: The bot sends a notification to a specific channel whenever a sale is verified.
